    "# Project Break Down\n",
    "## Question:\n",
    "The question I'm asking for this project is the UFS Prototype 7 Reforecast data accurate in showing cyclone events in and around the Southeast Region of the US. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Background Info\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why:\n",
    "If the model is able to reforecast these events, then future forecasting could better predict when and where significant events like tropical cyclones can occur.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## How:\n",
    "### Data Used:\n",
    "* Data from UFS: precipitation, surface temperature, and 500 hPa geopotential height daily data for August, September, October from 2011 to 2016. \n",
    "* Data from International Best Track Archive: hurricane tracks, wind speeds, and pressures for tropical cyclones within the lat/long bounds of UFS data during the specified months and years. \n",
    "* Data from Physical Sciences Laboratory: Hurricane Activity Index = monthly total of storms per month per year, Accumulated Cyclone Energy Index = monthly total of cyclone energy per month per year. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis Approach:\n",
    "* show contour plots of UFS data\n",
    "* show hurricane tracks, and plots of wind speed and pressures\n",
    "* show plots of hurricanes and UFS data on the corresponding days, see if any features align with the hurricane path. if not, why?\n",
    "* aggregating calculation (mean)\n",
    "* calculate climatology by month/year. for year climatology, looking for trends in increase/decrease in variables over the years (expecting ts to warm up over time, more intense precipitation and z500 etc)\n",
    "* calculate anomalies\n",
    "* composites with ha, ace, and tna\n",
    "* comparison plot using tna with indication of statistical significance\n",
    "* linear regression with tna\n",
    "* temporal correlation coefficient if i have time"
