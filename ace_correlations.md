We want to determine if there is a correlation between ACE and the UFS data.

# Correlation Between ACE and TS:

We see again that there is not significant correlation between surface temperature and ACE. Which does not seem to agree with expectations.

# Correlation Between ACE and Precip:

For precipitation, we see similar significance as with hurricane activity. The same positive and negative correlations are in relatively the same spots and with hurricane activity. Tennesse will allegedly see an increase in precipitation with a decrease in ACE, and vice versa. 

# Correlation Between ACE and z500:

For z500, we see a positive significant correlation over the continent stretching westward, and a negative correlation beginning at a similar latitude over the Atlantic Ocean.
