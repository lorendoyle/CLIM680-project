## Yearly Climatology

We can see that over the years for August through October, the surface warms up a bit, going from about 27 degrees Celsius to about 30 degrees Celsius. Something important to note about this data is that it is Surface Temperature, not Sea Surface Temperature.

We see an average precipitation of about 15 mm/day off of the Mississippi River Delta only in 2011, which could mean that for August, September and October, there were strong precipitation events there. And that would make sense because in 2011 we had Tropical Storm Lee hit the Louisiana gulf coast, where the strongest precipitation associated was over 300 mm/day. We can also see some spots of higher precipitation in the Atlantic in 2013 and around the Bahamas in 2016.

We can see the z500 contours move higher into the atmosphere over the years. 


## Monthly Climatology

As a monthly climatology, we can see that the surface temperature cools from August to October. In August, the average surface temperature is around 33 degrees celsius, and by October we have decreased to about 27 degrees Celsius, which is still favorable for tropical cyclones.

For precipitation, we still see a similar high precipitation near the Mississippi River Delta. We also see more precipitation contours around the Atlantic and Florida for September, and even more contours around the Bahamas in October. This could indicate that the yearly climatology was influenced by specific months throughout the 5 years, specifically August 2011, September 2013, and October 2016. Again, this isn't exactly accurate because the climatology was only take with 18 months worth of daily data, which isn't nearly enough data to make assumptions about trends.

We can see the average of the height contours in August is relatively high, and by October, we start to see lower height contours move in.

# Anomalies Used to Calculate Percentiles

I decided to plot the 95 Percentiles for surface temperature, precipitation, and 500 hPa geopotential height, and the 5 Percentiles for surface temperature and 500 hPa geopotential height to show if theres any extremes we can identify. 5 percentile is not calculated for precipitation because the precipitation can't be negative, and so the lowest it could be is 0 mm/day, which isn't really indicative of anything.
