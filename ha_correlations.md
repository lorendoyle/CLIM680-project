We want to know if there is any significant correlation between hurricane activity and the UFS data.

# Observations:
Obviously, we know logically that there is a correlation between hurricane activity and surface temperature, specifically that higher SSTs drive hurricanes. This means that there's most likely something wrong with how I calculated my anomalies. It could also be due to the fact that I am working with reforecast data, and so the farther away the day is from the initialization, the less accurate it will be. 

I also expected a higher correlation with precipitation than I got, which could be due to the same things as previously mentioned.
