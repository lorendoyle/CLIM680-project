I performed a linear regression on the data that had the more significant correlations: precipitation anomalies with ACE, HA, and TNA, and z500 with ACE and HA. Surface temperature did not have statistical significance.

# Observations:
The linear regressions performed are essentially identical to the correlations showing statistical significance performed, so this doesn't really tell us much beyond what the correlation told us. To get a better understanding of the correlation, a temporal correlation would be a better approach, for the future.

What we can at least interpret from these results though, is that
