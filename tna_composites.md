The TNA index is used to observe the trend in increased hurricane activity over time.

I used 0.4 degrees celsius as my threshold: meaning, if TNA was over 0.4 for any of the months in my dataset, I selected the corresponding months from my data and plotted the anomalies.
# TNA Above 0.4 with Surface Temperature Anomalies:
![tna_ts_comp](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114028135/204915558-32770b50-b05c-4ec6-b83e-8071e6ac670a.png)

We can see fairly neutral (the anomalies did not exceed 1) surface temperature anomalies associated with TNA above or equal to 0.4. Meaning that the dates in the surface temperature data that correspond with the dates of TNA >= 0.4 had very little variation in the yearly average

# TNA Above 0.4 with Precipitation Anomalies:

For precipitation, we see some slight positive anomalies over the states, with some negative anomalies in the Gulf, along the Atlantic coast of Florida, and over the Bahamas. Meaning that the dates in the precipitation data that correspond with the dates of TNA >= 0.4 were more negative than expected.

# TNA Above 0.4 with z500 Anomalies:
![tna_z500_comp](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114028135/204915846-9c65a50b-cd2b-4c9d-a9b0-55451d1cc5b4.png)

For z500, we see that the height contours are slightly lower than average over the Atlantic and slightly higher than average over the gulf.
