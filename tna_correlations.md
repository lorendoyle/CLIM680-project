We want to determine if there is a correlation between TNA and the UFS data.

# Correlation Between TNA and TS:

Once again, we see so significant correlation between surface temperature and TNA. 

# Correlation Between TNA and Precip:

For precipitation, this gives us the most significant correlation with any of the indices, which indicates that as TNA decreases, the precipitation over this region will increase, and as TNA increases, the precipitation over this region will decrease. This was not the result I was expecting.

# Correlation Between TNA and z500:

For z500, there does not appear to be any significant correlation between height contours and TNA.
